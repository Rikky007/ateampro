          <p>Bongani Fumnaya
Bongani was born in a small village in west Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>He is one of 15 children. His father was herdsman and he passed when Bongani was only two years old.</p>
 Poor Bongani had to help with the sheep since he was a little boy. That is why he did not get to go to school as the other kids in his village.
 He and his siblings have greatly suffered from malnutrition, because the mother did not have the income to cover the familyâ€™s needs.
 Despite all the hardship he always enjoyed playing and singing. He would use any spare minute to practice his performance with the drums
 When he grew up he found a wife and together they have 5 children. They work together at a coffee farm, producing fair trade coffee. 
Bongani would like to provide a better life for his family than he used to have as a kid. But he does not make enough at the coffee farm, 
so he is forced to make his children help him.</p>
